### Conclusions 
The data suggests that theater campaigns tend to be very succesful. It also suggests that Louise should start her campaign in May, the month with the highsest number of succesful campaigns according to the data provided. Louise wants to crowdfund $12,000, but according to the data the mean goal of succesful theater Kickstarters $5,049 and the median was $3,000, while the failed theater kickstarters had an average of $10,554 and a median goal of $5000.  With a Standard deviation of $7,749 - which is larger than the mean - shows a positive skew and everything below the mean is close to the center of distribution. In order to increase the odds of a successful campaign, then it would be better for Louise to lower her campaign goal and start it in May.
